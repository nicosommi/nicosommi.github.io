Yes!

Using eclipse. I came from Java so that was familiar for me and the V8 eclipse plugin works great and it’s easy to use. You just start node with –debug flag and connect the plugin to that port. It’s a very good alternative. You can also use Chrome browser the same way. But today I’m working on a lighter environment. Now I use Sublime Text and Gedit. Lose the fear to the console is something that we must do. Many of us learn that from ubuntu, git and such.

This came from real environments in which you have to solve a complexs issues all the time.

Many people can discuss about this and some maybe prefer to just trust in his skills… I don’t, I just prefer to not feel that pressure, I just want to know how to debug and detect problems watching the environment and using the tools the language provides for doing that."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Well… now that we know the benefits, let’s go deep on how do you do this.
